# RPG Inventory System (UE4)

This project aims to reproduce an inventory system similar to one you'd see in RPG games such as Baldur's Gate 3, Divinity Original Sin 2, or Pillars of Eternity 2. Characters have their own inventory, where each item takes up one cell in the grid. The player can decide in which cell what item should be and perform common actions, such as splitting, combining, or swapping items.

The main idea behind this project was to use it as a learning experience to teach myself how to create various multiplayer-ready game mechanics in Unreal Engine 4 using C++.

The repository contains only the C++ code for the project, as it makes use of a variety of paid assets, such as models and animations. More information about the project can be found on my [portfolio page](https://mkkurowski.wixsite.com/ilethas-portfolio/rpg-inventory-system-ue4). You can also see the inventory system in action in [this video](https://youtu.be/2qbNsEw56vg).
